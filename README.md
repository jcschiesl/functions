# Functions
First Practice with a program involving functions

###Process
This code challenge was slightly more time challenging than the "Hello, World!" program as it involved a 
mathematical function to run correctly before returning a response. The math itself was 
quite simple, aiding me in understaning the basic fundamentals of funtions in the 
Python language. I eventually began to look at some of the solution in ornder to ensure the structure that
the basic function was integrated within the code was correct. This process was quite smooth in that
upon first test my desired output was displayed; Always a good feeling.

After completing this task I had realized that I did not create a virtual environment for the 
code to run in. Upon this realization I asked Dr. Benton why I was still sucessful even though I forgot a step
in the early stages of setting up a program. I thereby was explained why we use virtual environments for 
many of our progams and also why it wasn't entirely nessesary or this program. This was my main takeaway 
aside from learning how to write function code in Python.
